# 🦖 _Trextter_ - A [Twitter](twitter.com) clone.

The project name is the mix between the word T-rex and Twitter (cool right? 😁).

It was supposed to be a simple twitter design 🙂

_Trextter_ uses a combination of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, all to show as much as possible of what I was thinking during those few days of creation.
