# *Trextter* - A [Twitter](twitter.com) clone.

> 😎 Check how the project is [https://lucianosimoni.github.io/html-twitter-challenge/](here) 👈
 
The project name is the mix between the word T-rex and Twitter (cool right? 😁).
It was supposed to be something simple... not that simple anymore tho 🙂

*Trextter* uses a combination of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, all to show as much as possible of what I was thinking during those few days of creation.

## External components used in the project

 - [**Material Design 3**](https://m3.material.io/)
	 - *As a design documentation on how components should be presented.*
 - [**Google Icons**](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
 - [**Dice Bear**](https://avatars.dicebear.com/)
	 - Generates random **svg** face drawings. Used as profile pictures.

## Assesment Criteria - Boolean
 - [x] Layout the main page elements (left-hand menu, tweet feed and right side-bar) using CSS Grid. CSS Grid should also be used to layout individual tweets.
 - [x] Define the page contents using HTML with appropriate elements. HTML should be well formatted.
 - [x] Style the page using a mixture of Type, ID and Class CSS selector types
 - [x] Implement hover and selected state for the left-hand menu links.

**Extension Criteria**

 - [x] Make the layout responsive so that the side-bars are removed on lower resolution devices
 - [x] Include images using the `img` and `svg` tags.
 - [x] ~~ Get the source for the icon images from the Twitter website as SVG and include them with `svg` tags.
	- *Used the [Google Material Symbols (icons)](https://fonts.google.com/icons) to get my icons. Found it smarter than adding each one with huge links*
 - [x] ~~ Use a local file for the profile image. Research how to use CSS to to make the profile image appear as a circle. 
	 - *Choose to use [Dice Bear](https://avatars.dicebear.com/) to get my profile pictures 🙂.  Randomizing the profile based on each name.*
