# _Trextter_ - A [Twitter](twitter.com) clone.

😎 Check how the project is [here](https://lucianosimoni.github.io/html-twitter-challenge/) 👈

The project name is the mix between the word T-rex and Twitter (cool right? 😁).
It was supposed to be a simple twitter design 🙂

_Trextter_ uses a combination of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, all to show as much as possible of what I was thinking during those few days of creation.

## External components used in the project

- [**Material Design 3**](https://m3.material.io/)
  - _As a design documentation on how components should be presented._
- [**Google Icons**](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [**Dice Bear**](https://avatars.dicebear.com/)
  - Generates random **svg** face drawings. Used as profile pictures.
