# _Trextter_ - A [Twitter](twitter.com) clone.

üòé Check how the project is [here](https://lucianosimoni.github.io/html-twitter-trextter/) üëà

The project name is the mix between the word T-rex and Twitter (cool right? üòÅ).
It was supposed to be a simple twitter design üôÇ

_Trextter_ uses a combination of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, all to show as much as possible of what I was thinking during those few days of creation.

## External components used in the project

- [**Material Design 3**](https://m3.material.io/)
  - _As a design documentation on how components should be presented._
- [**Google Icons**](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [**Dice Bear**](https://avatars.dicebear.com/)
  - Generates random **svg** face drawings. Used as profile pictures.

## Assesment Criteria - Boolean

- [x] Layout the main page elements (left-hand menu, tweet feed and right side-bar) using CSS Grid. CSS Grid should also be used to layout individual tweets.
- [x] Define the page contents using HTML with appropriate elements. HTML should be well formatted.
- [x] Style the page using a mixture of Type, ID and Class CSS selector types
- [x] Implement hover and selected state for the left-hand menu links.

**Extension Criteria**

- [x] Make the layout responsive so that the side-bars are removed on lower resolution devices
- [x] Include images using the `img` and `svg` tags.
- [x] ~~ Get the source for the icon images from the Twitter website as SVG and include them with `svg` tags.
  - _Used the [Google Material Symbols (icons)](https://fonts.google.com/icons) to get my icons. Found it smarter than adding each one with huge links_
- [x] ~~ Use a local file for the profile image. Research how to use CSS to to make the profile image appear as a circle.
  - _Choose to use [Dice Bear](https://avatars.dicebear.com/) to get my profile pictures üôÇ. Randomizing the profile based on each name._
